Compression experiments for pipeline parallel distributed deep learning

Run Instructions:
==============================
Experiments run use AWS Sagemaker and are launched from `src/launch_sagemaker.ipynb.` This requires you to have setup AWS Sagemaker yourself. You can do so following the quick start of this tutorial from AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/onboard-quick-start.html

In the notebook you will need to put in your AWS ACCESS KEY, S3 Buckets to write data to, and your Sagemaker ARN.
